# Webcmd AutoFix - Automatic Adapter Self-Repair

When a `webcmd` command fails because a website changed its DOM, API, or response schema, diagnose, fix the adapter, and retry. Do not only report the error when the failure is repairable.

## Safety Boundaries

Hard stops before any code change:

- **Human-action handoff:** if a failure returns `handoff.status === action_required`, stop before trace collection or AutoFix. Give the user `handoff.action` and any `Webcmd browser:` or `handoff.viewUrl` link, then wait. Never request or enter credentials, passwords, or CAPTCHA answers. After the user reports done, run `handoff.verifyCommand` when present; verification must succeed before retrying. Without a verifier, inspect fresh browser state and verify the intended post-action state before any retry, especially for write commands.
- **`AUTH_REQUIRED`** (exit code 77): if a site login command exists, run `webcmd <site> login`, give its `action_required` instructions and any returned `action_url` or `view_url` to the user, and wait. Run the returned `verify_command` (normally `webcmd <site> whoami`); verification must succeed before retrying the original command. If no site login command exists, stop browser writes, hand the visible browser to the user, and wait. After they report done, take fresh browser state and use an available identity check or verify the intended post-action state before retrying. Their report alone is not verification. Never request, type, echo, store, or automate passwords, OTPs, recovery codes, cookies, or session secrets.
- **`BROWSER_CONNECT`** (exit code 69): stop. Tell the user to run `webcmd doctor`.
- **CAPTCHA / raw-browser user takeover:** stop automation. Follow the human-action handoff above when one is returned; otherwise let the user act in the visible browser. Verification must succeed before retrying. With no verifier, take fresh browser state and verify the intended post-action state before any retry. The user's report alone is not verification. CAPTCHA is not an adapter issue.
- **Rate limiting / IP block:** stop. This is not an adapter issue.

Scope constraint:

- Modify only the file at `adapterSourcePath` in the trace `summary.md` front matter. That path is authoritative and may be `clis/<site>/...` in the repo or `plugins/<site>/...` in a plugin repo or `~/.webcmd/clis/<site>/...` for user-local installs.
- Never modify `src/`, `extension/`, `tests/`, `package.json`, or `tsconfig.json` during autofix.

Retry budget: maximum **3 repair rounds** per failure. A round is diagnose -> patch -> retry. If 3 rounds do not resolve it, stop and report what was tried.

## Prerequisite

```bash
webcmd doctor
```

This verifies extension and daemon connectivity for browser-dependent repairs.

## When To Use

Use this skill when `webcmd <site> <command>` fails with repairable errors:

- **SELECTOR:** element not found or DOM changed.
- **EMPTY_RESULT:** no data returned and evidence suggests a schema/API drift.
- **API_ERROR / NETWORK:** endpoint moved, params changed, or network contract broke.
- **PAGE_CHANGED:** page structure no longer matches the adapter.
- **COMMAND_EXEC:** runtime error in adapter logic.
- **TIMEOUT:** page loads differently or waits for the wrong signal.

## Before Repair: Empty Does Not Always Mean Broken

`EMPTY_RESULT`, and sometimes a structurally valid selector that returns no rows, may be a real platform answer rather than an adapter bug. Rule this out before a repair round:

- Retry with an alternative query or entry point. If `webcmd reddit search "X"` returns 0 but `webcmd reddit search "X guide"` returns 20, the adapter is likely fine and the first query was too narrow.
- Spot-check in a normal browser tab. If the data is visible there but the adapter is empty, the issue may be auth state, soft blocking, or rate limiting; use `webcmd doctor` or re-login rather than editing source.
- Look for soft 404s. Some platforms return HTTP 200 with an empty payload when an item is hidden, deleted, or temporarily unavailable. A retry after a short wait can distinguish transient hiding from real deletion.
- Treat a successful empty search as an answer. If the adapter reached the endpoint, got HTTP 200, and the platform returned `results: []`, report "no matches" instead of patching.

Proceed only when the empty or missing-selector result is reproducible across retries and alternative entry points.

## Before Repair: An Error Modal Is Not Always the Site's Verdict

Persistent-session adapters (`siteSession: 'persistent'`) share one tab per site, so error text in the body may be inherited or context-scoped rather than real. Before patching code:

- Check the trace screenshot and `location.href`: a modal over a blank page or the wrong URL means the tab carried stale DOM from a previous command, not that the site rejected this request.
- Check session-scoped context: sites often scope results to a selected city, date, or account. A "closed" / "unavailable" verdict can simply mean the browser's selected context does not match the request (for example, a seat layout opened while the site's location cookie points at another city).
- Reproduce in a clean tab (`webcmd browser open <url>`) before trusting the verdict. If it only fails in the adapter's persistent tab, fix state handling (`freshPage: true`, dismiss-and-renavigate, context preconditions) instead of selectors.

## Step 1: Collect Trace Context

Run the failing command with retained trace:

```bash
webcmd <site> <command> [args...] --trace retain-on-failure 2>trace-error.yaml
```

On failure, stderr contains the normal error envelope plus a `trace` block:

```yaml
ok: false
error:
  code: SELECTOR
  message: "Could not find element: .old-selector"
trace:
  schemaVersion: 1
  webcmdVersion: "..."
  traceId: "..."
  dir: "/path/to/.webcmd/profiles/default/traces/..."
  summaryPath: "/path/to/.webcmd/profiles/default/traces/.../summary.md"
  receiptPath: "/path/to/.webcmd/profiles/default/traces/.../receipt.json"
```

Read `summaryPath` first. It is the LLM-oriented entry point and includes:

```yaml
---
schemaVersion: 1
webcmdVersion: "..."
traceId: "..."
status: failure
site: "example"
command: "example/search"
adapterSourcePath: "/path/to/clis/example/search.js"
errorCode: "SELECTOR"
errorMessage: "Could not find element: .old-selector"
---
```

Trace artifacts include:

```text
summary.md
receipt.json
trace.jsonl
network.jsonl
console.jsonl
state/
screenshots/
```

Do not ask the user to rerun with legacy diagnostic environment variables. Trace artifacts are the repair evidence path.

## Step 2: Analyze The Failure

Read the trace summary and adapter source. Classify root cause:

| Error code | Likely cause | Repair strategy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SELECTOR | DOM restructured or class/id changed | Explore current DOM and find a stable selector |
| EMPTY_RESULT | API response schema changed, data moved, or real empty result | Check network and visible page before patching |
| API_ERROR | Endpoint URL changed or new params required | Discover current API through network evidence |
| AUTH_REQUIRED | Login flow changed or cookies expired | Follow the conditional AUTH_REQUIRED policy in Safety Boundaries: use the site login command and its returned verifier when available; otherwise use human handoff plus fresh-state supported verification. |
| TIMEOUT | Page loads differently or lazy-load signal changed | Update wait conditions |
| PAGE_CHANGED | Major redesign | May need full adapter rewrite through `webcmd-adapter-author` |

Answer these questions:

1. What is the adapter trying to do? Read `adapterSourcePath`.
2. What did the page look like when it failed? Read `summary.md`, then `state/` if needed.
3. What network requests happened? Read failed network in `summary.md`, then `network.jsonl` if needed.
4. What gap exists between adapter expectations and current page reality?

## Step 3: Explore The Current Website

Use `webcmd browser` to inspect the live site. Do not use the broken adapter for exploration.

For DOM changes:

```bash
webcmd browser open https://example.com/target-page
webcmd browser state
```

For API changes:

```bash
webcmd browser open https://example.com/target-page
webcmd browser state
webcmd browser click <N>
webcmd browser network
webcmd browser network --filter author,text,likes
webcmd browser network --detail <key>
```

Use the `key` field from network output with `--detail`.

## Step 4: Patch The Adapter

Patch only `adapterSourcePath`.

Common fixes:

```js
// Selector update
document.querySelector('.new-class')
```

```js
// Endpoint update
fetch('/api/v2/search')
```

```js
// Response schema update
const items = data.data.items;
```

```js
// Wait condition update
await page.wait({ selector: '[data-loaded="true"]' });
```

Rules:

1. Make minimal changes; do not refactor unrelated code.
2. Keep output structure compatible: `columns` and row keys must remain aligned.
3. Prefer stable API evidence over brittle DOM scraping when discovered.
4. Use only `@agentrhq/webcmd/*` imports; do not add third-party packages.
5. Test after patching.
6. Never relax `verify/<cmd>.json` fixtures to silence a failure. A failing `patterns`, `notEmpty`, `mustNotContain`, or `mustBeTruthy` rule usually means adapter output is wrong. Edit a fixture only when the site itself legitimately changed shape, such as a URL format migration, and note the change in `~/.webcmd/sites/<site>/notes.md`.

## Step 5: Verify The Fix

Run:

```bash
webcmd <site> <command> [args...]
```

If it still fails, collect a fresh trace and start another round. Stop after 3 rounds.

## Step 6: Report A Reproducible Upstream Defect

Offer to file an upstream issue after either outcome:

- A local adapter repair was verified and should be contributed upstream.
- A Webcmd defect remains reproducible after the three-round retry budget.

Do not file for `AUTH_REQUIRED`, `BROWSER_CONNECT`, `ARGUMENT`, or `CONFIG`;
CAPTCHA, rate limiting, IP blocking, site policy restrictions, successful empty
results, invalid input, transient network failures, or unreproduced failures.

Include the sanitized command, reproduction steps, expected and actual behavior,
error code/excerpt, Webcmd/Node/OS versions, trace ID, and any verified local fix.
Remove credentials, cookies, authorization headers, browser session data,
private content, personal data, and raw trace artifacts.

Show the title and body to the user and get approval unless automatic filing was
already authorized. Then check their existing GitHub login:

```bash
gh auth status
```

If `gh` is unavailable or unauthenticated, explain that sign-in is required and
stop without requesting a token. Otherwise, submit the approved, redacted draft:

```bash
gh issue create \
  --repo "${WEBCMD_FEEDBACK_REPO:-agentrhq/webcmd}" \
  --title "[Bug]: <site>/<command>: <short failure summary>" \
  --body "<approved, sanitized draft>"
```

Report the issue URL after GitHub confirms creation. If submission fails, show
the error without retrying.

## When To Stop

Hard stops:

- `AUTH_REQUIRED` / `BROWSER_CONNECT`: environment issue, not adapter bug.
- Site requires CAPTCHA.
- Rate limited or IP blocked.

Soft stops:

- 3 repair rounds exhausted.
- Feature completely removed.
- Major redesign requiring `webcmd-adapter-author`.

For a reproducible Webcmd defect at a soft stop, offer the Step 6 reporting flow.

In all stop cases, clearly report the situation instead of making speculative patches.

## Example Repair Session

```text
1. User runs: webcmd reddit hot
   -> Fails: SELECTOR "Could not find element: .old-post-selector"

2. Agent runs: webcmd reddit hot --trace retain-on-failure 2>trace-error.yaml
   -> Gets trace summary with final state and failed action evidence

3. Agent reads summary/state:
   -> Page loaded, but post cards now use "[data-testid=post-container]"

4. Agent explores:
   -> webcmd browser open https://www.reddit.com && webcmd browser state

5. Agent patches adapterSourcePath:
   -> Replace old selector with stable scoped selector

6. Agent verifies:
   -> webcmd reddit hot
   -> Success: returns hot posts

7. Agent prepares upstream issue draft and asks the user

8. User approves:
   -> gh issue create --repo agentrhq/webcmd --title "[autofix] reddit/hot: SELECTOR" --body "..."
```
