# Webcmd Adapter Authoring

You are an agent writing an adapter for a site. The goal of this skill is a 30-minute loop from zero context to a passing `webcmd browser verify`.

Use the existing tools throughout: `webcmd browser *`, `webcmd doctor`, `webcmd browser init`, and `webcmd browser verify`. This skill does not introduce new commands.

Browser-profile auth commands must reuse `registerSiteAuthCommands`. Keep only site-specific `verify` and `openLogin` logic in the adapter. The login row must return `action_required` and `verify_command` (normally `webcmd <site> whoami`); after the user reports done, agents run that returned command and verification must succeed before retrying the original workflow. Credentials, MFA, and CAPTCHA always use human handoff: CAPTCHA stops automation until the user reports done and verification succeeds, and adapter code must not collect or type passwords or secrets.

Commands whose primary operation searches or discovers matching items from a corpus must set `tags: ['search']`. Add short `keywords` only for non-obvious intent synonyms; do not infer tags from command names alone when authoring new adapters.

When debugging browser-backed adapters, start with `--trace on --keep-tab true --window foreground`. `--trace on` writes a trace artifact every round, and `summary.md` is the entry point for reviewing both failures and successes. `--keep-tab true --window foreground` keeps the tab lease alive and puts the browser window in front so you can inspect the final page state.

## Precheck: Know Your Lane

Use `coverage-matrix.md` for a quick self-test before implementation. Ask three questions:

1. Can the data be seen in the browser? If no, solve authentication first.
2. Is the data HTTP, JSON, or HTML? If no, this skill is out of scope.
3. Does the command require real-time push? If yes, look for an HTTP endpoint with the same data; if none exists, stop.

Continue only when all three answers are yes.

---

## Top-Level Decision Tree

**Choose the strategy before writing the adapter.** Every time you reach Step 3 or Step 4, and before writing code, produce a strategy note. Without that note, do not start an adapter file.

The core question is not whether an API is more elegant than DOM work. The core question is whether the data source has an external contract. Public or official interfaces are usually the most stable. UI/DOM semantics often have a user-visible contract too. Undocumented in-site XHR, GraphQL, or signature endpoints drift the most. Do not move a stable UI/DOM implementation to an uncontracted internal endpoint just to be "API-first."

Strategy note template:

```md
Strategy: PUBLIC_API | COOKIE_API | UI_SELECTOR | DOM_STATE | PAGE_FETCH | INTERCEPT
Contract: stable | visible-ui | internal-unstable
Evidence:
- observed request/state:
- auth source:
- replay result:
Why not simpler:
- PUBLIC_API:
- COOKIE_API:
- UI_SELECTOR/DOM_STATE:
```

| Strategy | Contract level | Use when | Evidence required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PUBLIC_API` | stable | Node-side `fetch` can get target data without login | 200 + JSON/HTML contains target data, not analytics or ads |
| `COOKIE_API` | stable | Node-side `fetch` plus `page.getCookies()` / header helper can get the data | cookie/CSRF source is clear and replay is non-empty |
| `UI_SELECTOR` | visible-ui | publish/upload/click/form flows, or page semantics are more stable than internal APIs | selector has a semantic anchor; failure path is a typed error |
| `DOM_STATE` | visible-ui | data is in hydration state, bootstrap JSON, or SSR HTML | state key, script JSON, or HTML structure is clear |
| `PAGE_FETCH` | internal-unstable | only page-context `fetch` can reuse same-origin/session/runtime state | `webcmd browser eval fetch(...)` is non-empty; explain why the internal endpoint is unavoidable |
| `INTERCEPT` | internal-unstable | request signing is complex but the page can naturally issue the request | target response is captured after triggering UI; explain why UI/DOM is insufficient |

Selection rule: prefer `PUBLIC_API` / `COOKIE_API`. If UI/DOM semantics are stable, do not force an upgrade to `PAGE_FETCH` / `INTERCEPT`. Pay the maintenance cost of uncontracted internal endpoints only when public/official APIs are unavailable and UI/DOM cannot express the target data or operation.

Observed maintenance pattern: `PAGE_FETCH` / `INTERCEPT` fixes are roughly 7-8x as frequent as `PUBLIC_API` fixes, while `UI_SELECTOR` is in the same rough band as `COOKIE_API`. See [`references/strategy-selection.md`](./references/strategy-selection.md) for the ladder, `api_candidates` evidence guidance, and counterexamples such as the booking #1680 case.

Boundary: reuse only data and capabilities the page has already obtained legitimately. Do not teach signature cracking, CAPTCHA bypass, risk-control bypass, or access-control bypass. If a signature cannot be reused safely, such as a runtime-generated page signature that cannot be abstracted, fall back to `UI_SELECTOR`, `DOM_STATE`, or `INTERCEPT`.

## Runbook

Check these off step by step:

[ ] 1. `webcmd doctor` returns "Everything looks good"

[ ] 2. Read site memory:
       [ ] Does `~/.webcmd/sites/<site>/endpoints.json` exist, and does it contain the desired endpoint?
       [ ] Does `references/site-memory/<site>.md` exist? If yes, read its "Known endpoints" section.
       [ ] On a hit: **jump to Step 5 endpoint verification + Step 7 field check**, not directly to Step 9 adapter code.
       [ ] If memory is older than 30 days according to `verified_at`, treat it as stale and use the cold-start path through Steps 3 and 4.

[ ] 3. Recon (`site-recon.md`):
       [ ] **Preferred:** `webcmd browser analyze <url>` to get pattern, anti-bot signals, nearest adapter, and next step in one pass.
       [ ] If `analyze` is ambiguous, run manual checks: `open` -> `wait time 2` (or `wait xhr <regex>`) -> `network`.
       [ ] Choose Pattern A / B / C / D / E.

[ ] 4. API discovery (`api-discovery.md`) by Pattern:
       [ ] Pattern A -> section 1 network deep read.
       [ ] Pattern B -> section 2 state extraction + section 1 for deeper data.
       [ ] Pattern C -> section 3 bundle / script src search.
       [ ] Pattern D -> section 4 token source + section 5 fallback.
       [ ] Pattern E -> find an HTTP polling endpoint; use section 5 only if none exists.

[ ] 5. Directly verify the candidate endpoint:
       [ ] Response is 200.
       [ ] Response contains target data, not HTML, ads, or analytics.

[ ] 6. Write the strategy note before code:
       [ ] Choose one of `PUBLIC_API / COOKIE_API / PAGE_FETCH / INTERCEPT / DOM_STATE / UI_SELECTOR`.
       [ ] Fill Contract: `stable / visible-ui / internal-unstable`.
       [ ] Fill Evidence: observed request/state, auth source, replay result.
       [ ] If choosing `PAGE_FETCH` / `INTERCEPT`, explain why `PUBLIC_API`, `COOKIE_API`, `UI_SELECTOR`, and `DOM_STATE` are not suitable.
       [ ] If choosing `UI_SELECTOR` / `DOM_STATE`, do not over-defend why it is not an API; state the semantic anchor and typed-error path.

[ ] 7. Field decoding:
       [ ] Self-explanatory key -> use it directly.
       [ ] Known code -> look it up in `field-conventions.md`.
       [ ] Unknown code -> use `field-decode-playbook.md` (sort-key comparison, structural diff, constant checks).

[ ] 8. Design columns (`output-design.md`):
       [ ] Use camelCase names aligned with neighboring adapters.
       [ ] Make types, units, and percentage format clear.
       [ ] Order: identifier columns -> business numbers -> metadata.

[ ] 9. Write the adapter (`adapter-template.md`):
       [ ] `webcmd browser init <site>/<name>`, then set `strategy: Strategy.<strategy>` in the generated file
       [ ] Find the closest same-site or same-type adapter and copy it.
       [ ] Edit name, URL, and field mapping.

[ ] 10. Verification fixtures:
        [ ] After the first passing run, immediately use `--write-fixture` to seed `~/.webcmd/sites/<site>/verify/<cmd>.json`.
        [ ] Tighten the seed by adding `patterns` (URL/date/ID formats), `notEmpty` (core fields), and stricter `rowCount`.
        [ ] Run `webcmd browser verify <site>/<name>` again and confirm it matches the fixture.

[ ] 11. Compare field values against the visible page. Do not stop at "Adapter works!"

[ ] 12. Write site memory after **verify passes and visible-page comparison matches**. See `references/site-memory.md` for schema:
        [ ] `endpoints.json`: short endpoint name as key; value = `{url, method, params.{required,optional}, response, verified_at: YYYY-MM-DD, notes}`.
        [ ] `field-map.json`: append only new codes. key = field code; value = `{meaning, verified_at: YYYY-MM-DD, source}`. **Do not overwrite existing keys.** If there is a conflict, align with the visible page before writing.
        [ ] `notes.md`: prepend `## YYYY-MM-DD by <agent/user>` with new pitfalls or conclusions from this adapter work.
        [ ] `verify/<cmd>.json`: **required.** Expected values for `webcmd browser verify`: args, rowCount, columns, types, patterns, notEmpty. Step 10 generated this; this item is the checklist gate.
        [ ] `fixtures/<cmd>-<YYYYMMDDHHMM>.json`: save one complete endpoint response sample after removing cookies, tokens, and private user fields. Use it for later field comparison and offline replay.
        [ ] If debugging dumped temporary files in the repo or adapter directory, such as `.dbg-*.html`, `raw-*.json`, or similar, **delete them before commit**. Those belong in `~/.webcmd/sites/<site>/fixtures/` or `/tmp/`.

[ ] 13. **First command for this site? Stop and ask before building more.**
        [ ] If this was the site's first command, do not silently keep scaffolding more commands. Ask the user what use cases they have in mind for this site — who the persona is, what they're trying to accomplish end to end.
        [ ] From the use cases, propose the full set of commands you'd recommend adding, not just the obvious next one. Cover the whole journey the use cases imply (discovery, single-item detail, comparison, account/write actions, etc.), not only what's cheapest to build.
        [ ] If that set is small (roughly ≤6-8 commands), list it flat and ask the user to confirm or trim it.
        [ ] If it's large, bucket the commands into named groups (e.g. "Discovery", "Single-item evaluation", "Account actions requiring login") and ask the user which bucket(s) to build first — do not dump an unbucketed wall of commands.
        [ ] Flag any bucket that needs a capability not yet solved (login/OTP, write access, payment) as its own decision point — e.g. "these need login — how do you want to handle auth?" — separate from the command list itself.
        [ ] Do not scaffold additional commands until the user has confirmed which ones to build.

## Fallback Paths

| Stuck at | Symptom | Go to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Step 4 API discovery | `network` is empty and `__INITIAL_STATE__` is empty | section 3 bundle search for baseURL |
| | bundle search cannot find baseURL | section 5 intercept |
| Step 5 endpoint verification | 401 / 403 | section 4 token investigation |
| | 200 but response is HTML | return to Step 3 and reassess Pattern |
| | 200 but `data: []` is empty | wrong params or endpoint version changed; return to section 1 and inspect real network headers |
| Step 7 field decoding | sort-key comparison is inconclusive | field-decode-playbook.md section 3 structural diff |
| | still inconclusive | output raw values first, get the adapter running, then iterate |
| Step 10 verify fails | missing filter / wrong field mapping | autofix skill; rerun with `--trace retain-on-failure` |
| | a column is always `null` | field path is wrong; return to Step 7 |
| Step 10 verify fixture mismatch | `[pattern]` row[i] failure | compare visible page value first. If value is right, loosen fixture pattern; if value is wrong, fix mapping |
| | `[column] missing column "X"` | actual response lacks this column due to site change or args; rerun `--update-fixture` or fix adapter |
| | `[type]` actual null / undefined | extraction failed; return to Step 7. Use a `string|null` union only when the value is truly nullable |
| Step 11 values mismatch | value differs by 10,000x | unit mismatch |
| | percentage is 100x too small | response already uses `0.025`; do not multiply by 100 |

## Key Conventions

- Adapters import only `@agentrhq/webcmd/registry` and `@agentrhq/webcmd/errors`; do not add third-party dependencies.
- The `columns` array and `func` return object keys must match exactly, including order.
- **Intermediate parsing object keys must not overlap any `columns` entry.** Otherwise silent-column-drop audits can misread the adapter. Use dedicated internal names and destructure with aliases when pushing rows.
- **The `browser:` field determines the `func` signature:** `browser:false -> (args)`, `browser:true -> (page, args)`. If this is reversed, `args` may actually be a debug flag and all external parameters can silently fall back to defaults.
- Throw the correct typed error for known failures according to [`references/typed-errors.md`](./references/typed-errors.md). **Do not** silently `return []`, **do not** silently `return [{sentinel}]`, and **do not** silently clamp external parameters with `Math.max/min`.
- **Persistent sessions keep stale DOM between commands.** `siteSession: 'persistent'` shares one tab per site; leftover modals/drawers from the previous command leak into the next one. State-sensitive write commands (checkout flows) should add `freshPage: true` (new tab, same lease — cookies/login/location survive). Verify session-scoped context (login, selected city/date) *before* side effects, and embed such context in URLs/IDs your command emits for sibling commands. See `references/adapter-template.md` and "Persistent Sessions and State Hygiene" in `docs/authoring.mdx`.
- For private iteration, write `~/.webcmd/clis/<site>/<name>.js` to avoid a build. When the user says to promote a CLI, create a main-repo plugin with `webcmd plugin create <site> --dir plugins/<site>`, copy the real command files into it, delete scaffold sample commands, register it in root `webcmd-plugin.json`, remove the local `~/.webcmd/clis/<site>` shadow, install the plugin, then run `webcmd validate <site>` and smoke commands. See `references/adapter-template.md` for details.
- Write site memory every round: no memory -> use skill -> produce memory -> next time becomes a five-minute task.
- **After a site's first command passes verify, stop and ask the user for their use cases before recommending next set of commands.** See Runbook Step 13.
- **Raw dumps, packet captures, and HTML samples from debugging may only be written to `~/.webcmd/sites/<site>/fixtures/` or `/tmp/`. Never leave `.dbg-*.html`, `raw-*.json`, `sample.*`, or similar temporary files in the repo root, `clis/<site>/`, or the current working directory.**
- **JSDOM unit-test fixtures (`clis/<site>/__fixtures__/<command>.html`) are the exception.** They are intentional review artifacts committed to the repo, not temporary dumps. Because of that, the quality bar is higher: complete the five steps in `references/jsdom-fixture-pattern.md`, including the mandatory `awk 'NF>0'` blank-line tightening, and reverse-validate once to prove the regression guard can fail.

## If You Are Stuck

- Diagnostic path: `webcmd doctor` -> inspect `notes.md` -> rerun with `--trace retain-on-failure`.
- Endpoint path: return to `site-recon` and reclassify Pattern. Do not stay attached to the first API guess.
- Field path: compare one visible page value, then use sort-key comparison, structural diff, and constants.
- Verification path: if `webcmd browser verify` fails, switch to the autofix skill instead of improvising.
